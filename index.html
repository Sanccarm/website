<p>I have a deep passion for computers, IT security, and building strong communities through technology. I love learning about how systems work and, more importantly, how to protect them from security threats. My goal is to work in IT, where I can use my skills to solve problems, keep information safe, and help others navigate the tech world. I enjoy collaborating with like-minded individuals and constantly expanding my knowledge to stay ahead in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity.</p>
